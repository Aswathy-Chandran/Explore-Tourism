      <p>Known for the scenic beauty, natural beauty and other attractions, Kerala tourism never had to look back ever in its growth.
         Kerala is known for its densely forested mountain ranges comprising the Western Ghats and covering tropical evergreen, deciduous and semi-deciduous jungles that are home to some rare, exotic plant life and wildlife species. These hill stations and high range zones are the favourite haunts of nature and wildlife enthusiasts.

        The high and rugged Western Ghats endow the state with a number of Hillstations, which unlike the rest of the state have a high rate of tourist influx during the summer months. On these hill slopes are cultivated expansive stretches of coffee, tea, rubber and fragrant spices such as cardamom, pepper and clove. Kerala tourism promotes long chain of lush, mid-clad hill stations that are home to exotic wildlife. Kerala offer the most enchanting experience of nature in all its virgin beauty.
        
        Kerala Tourism has its hills which offer pleasant and pleasurable diversions that range from going on hiking, biking, trekking and hill climbing tours to wildlife safaris to the numerous wildlife sanctuaries located on the Kerala hills in Kerala.</p>
