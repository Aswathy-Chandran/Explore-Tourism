    Thrissur, a commercial and cultural centre, is considered to be the oldest city on the west coast of India. Its name means “small sacred place.” The city is built around a hillock topped by the Vadakkumnathan Temple (dedicated to Shiva), the focus of an annual festival. A city of many faiths, Thrissur is also home to some of the oldest mosques and churches in the country. Its industries include cotton weaving, rice and oilseed milling, soap manufacturing, and sawmilling.

Thrissur is one of the oldest cities in Kerala. The legend says, the city was the town created by Lord Parasurama (6th incarnation of Lord Vishnu) soon after formation of Kerala, by creating a large Shiva temple. The entire city is formed around the grand Shiva temple known as Vadakumnathan Temple. The city's original name was Thir-Shiva-Perur (Sacred city of Shiva), which got later shortened as Thrissur. The temple is in the center of a mega roundabout that is of 64 acres. This round is known as Swaraj Round and the giant square in front of the temple is known as Thekkinkad Maidan. All roads of Thrissur connect to this.

Perhaps when Indians think of Thrissur, the first image would be the famous Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival of Kerala. This is also known as largest temple festival in India. The festival is at the Vadakkumnathan temple grounds, in April or May. The city is equally famous for the final celebrations of the Onam festival, which is the national festival of Kerala. It hosts the famous Pulikali during Onam celebrations in August or September (depends on Malayalam calendar). Apart from festivals and culture, Thrissur is also well known as one of the best shopping centers in Kerala for silks and gold ornaments. The city is also known as Entrepreneurial City, due to presence of large number of entrepreneurs working in various trades.
